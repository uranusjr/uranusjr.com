<p class="work">aka @uranusjr</p>
The first question I get whenever I meet someone who know me as my Internet alias for the first time in person is always the same: *How do I pronounce your alias?* Well, this is my answer:

**Don't.**

I started using **uranusjr** as my Internet alias since high school because I like Uranus, the seventh planet in the solar system. Uranus is one of the darker, slower, and low-profile planet in our system, but is "quietly eccentric," being the only planet of the eight that rotates *vertically*. (I can talk all day about cool things about Uranus, but let's stop here.)

I decided to take that name, but was disappointed when I found that the alias was taken (of course) in the largest BBS in my high school. I added *jr*, and have been using it ever since.

So, as you can see, uranusjr is not really a name made to be pronounced. If you really bother to call me a name, just use **TP**, my initials. I like that.

And you can find me just about everywhere on the Internet by searching for user **uranusjr**â€”I'm sure that I am not famous enough to have fake accounts.
