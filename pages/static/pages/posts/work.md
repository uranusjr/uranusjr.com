I am currently employed by [Astronomer] to contribute to [Apache Airflow], an open source workflow management tool mainly used for data engineering pipelines. I also hold a role for [CYTC] to help develop and maintain their commercial environment monitoring and control system. My main focus is currently on Python, but also makes me dabble on various web technologies, embedded system, and SOC development. I also previously work heavily on Django, C++ and Qt, and Objective-C.

I spend most of my off time participating in open source communities and contributing to open source projects. I am a maintainer of [pip], Python’s package installer, a member of the [Python Packaging Authority] (PyPA), and participate in the Python Software Foundation Work Groups on packaging and funding. I created [MacDown], a Markdown editor for Mac, and [Qelly], a cross-platform BBS client written in C++ upon Qt. I also help organise [PyCon Taiwan], and served as Chairperson during 2017–2018.
